#Given angles wrt axes:90degrees,135degrees,45degrees

print("values of cosines of angles wrt axes is given as")
m=np.cos(np.array((90., 135., 45.)) * np.pi / 180.)
print(m)
print("Therefore Magnitude of the vector:")
print(np.linalg.norm(m))

# Hence unit vector is m is 
m = m/(np.linalg.norm(m))
print("The value of unit vector m is", m)
values of cosines of angles wrt axes is given as
[ 6.12323400e-17 -7.07106781e-01  7.07106781e-01]
Therefore Magnitude of the vector:
1.0
The value of unit vector m is [ 6.12323400e-17 -7.07106781e-01  7.07106781e-01]
